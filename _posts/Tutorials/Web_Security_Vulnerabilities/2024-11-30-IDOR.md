## What is IDOR?

![IDOR_Graph](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/IDOR_Graph.png)

Insecure Direct Object Reference, also known as IDOR, is a type of access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses user input to access objects such as data or files directly. This can allow attackers to manipulate the input and access unauthorized information, potentially leaking sensitive data.

Example:

Assume an application allows users to access their profiles using the following URL:

`http://example.com/users/?userID=4`

If the application doesn't properly check if the user has access to view the profile information before displaying it, an attacker can change the `userID` to access another user's data:

`http://example.com/users/?userID=1`

If the website does not properly validate the user's access rights, the attacker can access the profile information of another user (user with ID 1 in this case) without being authorized to do so. This is an example of an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability.

## What is the impact of IDOR?

The impact of an IDOR vulnerability depends on the application's data. Some potential impacts of IDOR include:

- unauthorized access to user's data
- chaining IDOR to account takeover
- Attackers may modify or delete data, leading to loss of data integrity and reliability.

## Where to find IDOR?

To find IDOR vulnerabilities, there are some places to search for:

1. **Numeric Identifiers**

   Applications uses numeric identifiers to access resources or specific data. So, attackers try to manipulate these numbers to access unauthorized data or resources.

   Example:

   ```https
   GET /profile/user/1234 HTTP/1.0 --> GET /profile/user/1235 HTTP/1.0
   ```

2. **Username Manipulation** 

   Some applications use username to access profile data or any sensitive data related to specific user, So attackers try to change username to access other's data.

   Example:

   ```
   GET /profile/?username=jack HTTP/1.0 --> GET /profile/?username=john HTTP/1.0
   ```

3. **Resource Path Manipulation**

   Suppose an application uses the following URL to access some data:

   ```
   GET /files/?file=home.php
   ```

   Attackers manipulate the `file` parameter trying to access sensitive data

   ``` 
   GET /files/?file=secret.php
   ```

4. **POST Request Parameters**

   Attackers here try to manipulate `POST` request parameters (e.g. change user ID, ) to modify or access sensitive/unauthorized data.

   Example:

   ```
   POST /profile/edit HTTP/1.0
   HOST: example.com
   ...
   
   username=john123&firstname=john&lastname=doe
   ```

   After manipulation

   ```
   POST /profile/edit HTTP/1.0
   HOST: example.com
   ...
   
   username=jack432&firstname=john&lastname=doe
   ```

5. **Cookie-based**

   Suppose an application uses cookies to identify and authorize users to access specific data, here attackers try to change value of cookie to access unauthorized data.

   Example:

   ```
   GET /profile HTTP/1.0
   Cookie: user_id=1234
   ```

   After manipulation

   ```
   GET /profile HTTP/1.0
   Cookie: user_id=1235
   ```

6. **API (Application Programming Interface)**

   API can be vulnerable to IDOR if it leaks sensitive data.

   Example:

   ``` 
   GET /api/v1/messages HTTP/1.0 --> GET /api/v2/messages HTTP/1.0
   GET /api/v1/users/1 HTTP/1.0 --> GET /api/v1/users/2 HTTP/1.0
   ```

## Some IDOR Bypasses

1. **Change file type**

   ```shell
   GET /user_data/1234 ---> 401
   GET /user_data/1234.json ---> 200
   GET /user_data/1234.xml ---> 200
   GET /user_data/1234.config ---> 200
   GET /user_data/1234.txt ---> 200
   ```

2. **Send wildcard (`*`)**

   ```
   GET /api/v1/users/user_id ---> GET /api/users/* HTTP/1.1
   ```

3. **Change ID to username**

   ```
   GET /api/v1/users/1234 HTTP/1.0 ---> GET /api/v1/users/jack HTTP/1.0
   ```

4. **Swap UUIDs with numbers**

   ```
   GET /file?id=90ri2-xozifke-29ikedaw0d HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   ...
   
   Try this to bypass
   
   GET /file?id=1234
   Host: example.com
   ...
   ```

5. **Analyze JS files for leaked IDs**

   ```
   POST /api/v1/users/ HTTP/1.0
   
   user_id=1234&user_id=1235
   ```

6. **Analyze JS files for leaked IDs**

## How to prevent IDOR?

To prevent Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities, consider implementing the following measures:

1. **Use Indirect Object References & Unique Identifiers**

   Instead of using direct object references, use indirect references that are mapped to the actual objects on the server side. This way, even if the user manipulates the reference, they cannot access unauthorized data.

   **Example:**

   Instead of `https://www.example.com/users/?userID=36`, use `https://www.example.com/users/?userID=ffc61035-b579-44e0-b7fc-199bb005cdde`.

2. **Validate User Input**

   Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious input that could be used to manipulate object references.

## Time to practice

Now let's practice what we've learned and see how we can find `IDOR` in a real-world scenario.

### Challenge #1

> **Goal**: Access sensitive data.
>
> **Login Credentials:**
>
> **Username:** Jack
>
> **Password:** password123

We can see login page and the challenge provide us with the credentials, so let's login and check the website.

![Challenge_intro](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_intro.png)

After logging in, we will be presented with a dashboard that has three functionalities: `View Profile`, `Edit Profile`, and `Logout`.

![Challenge_jack](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_jack.png)

On the `View Profile` page, we can see Jack's sensitive information, such as his card number. Take note of how this data is presented.

![View_Profile_1](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/View_Profile_1.png)

Next, navigate to the `Edit Profile` page where we can change Jack's email address. Try changing it to `hacking@example.com` and observe what happens.

![Challenge_edit](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_edit.png) 

![Challenge_edit_test](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_edit_test.png)

Notice the `id` parameter in the URL. Attempt to change the `id` from `1` to `2` and observe if we can access another user's profile.

As we can see, changing the `id` allows us to access Bob's profile, which is an IDOR vulnerability.

![Challenge_test_1](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_test_1.png)



![Challenge_test_2](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_test_2.png)

Let's try changing the `id` to `3` to see if we can access another user's profile. In John's profile, we might notice a message indicating a leaked password.

![John_Profile](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/John_Profile.png)

View the page's source code, and we can find a base64 encoded string.

![Challenge_exploit_1.1](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_exploit_1.1.png)

So let's decrypt it using `CyberChef` and get the password of `john`.

![Challenge_exploit_1,2](/assets/images/tutorials/Web_Security_Vulnerabilities/IDOR/Challenge/Challenge_exploit_1,2.png)

Now, we can login to `John` account and access the profile.
