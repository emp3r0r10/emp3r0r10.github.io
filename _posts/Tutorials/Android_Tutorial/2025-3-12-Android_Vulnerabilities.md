## **1- Improper Credential Usage**

Insecure credential management can occur when mobile apps use hardcoded credentials or when credentials are misused. Here are some indicators that your mobile app may be vulnerable:

- Hardcoded Credentials: If the mobile app contains hardcoded credentials within the app’s source code or any configuration files, this is a clear indicator of vulnerability.
- Insecure Storage of Credentials: Storing user credentials locally on the device, often in an easily accessible format, exposes sensitive information to potential attackers.
- Weak Password Policies: Apps that don’t enforce strong password policies are susceptible to brute force attacks, as simple passwords and lack of complexity requirements make it easier for malicious actors to guess or crack passwords.
- Inadequate Encryption: Transmitting credentials without proper encryption leaves personal information vulnerable, akin to sending a postcard for anyone to read.
- Unsecured Authentication Processes: Some apps overlook secure authentication processes, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), making it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access with compromised passwords.
- Failure to Implement Session Management: Poor session management practices, like not expiring sessions after inactivity, expose users to session hijacking and related attacks.

**Prevention:**

- Implementing Robust Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data, including credentials, is transmitted and stored using strong encryption methods.
- Enforcing Strong Password Policies: Require users to create complex passwords and regularly update them to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks.
- Embracing Secure Authentication Methods: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
- Improving Session Management: Implement secure session management practices, including session expiration after a period of inactivity, to prevent session hijacking.
- Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.

## **2- Inadequate Supply Chain Security**

An attacker can manipulate application functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities in the mobile app supply chain. For example, an attacker can insert malicious code into the mobile app’s codebase or modify the code during the build process to introduce backdoors, spyware, or other malicious code.

This can allow the attacker to steal data, spy on users, or take control of the mobile device. Moreover, an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software libraries, SDKs, vendors, or hardcoded credentials to gain access to the mobile app or the backend servers.

This can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation, denial of service, or complete takeover of the mobile app or device.

**Prevention:**

1. Secure Build Environments: Implement stringent security measures in the build environment, including multi-factor authentication, regular security audits, and access controls. Regularly update and patch all components of the build infrastructure to minimize vulnerabilities.
2. Code Signing and Integrity Checks: Utilize code signing to ensure the authenticity of the code throughout the supply chain. Implement regular integrity checks to detect any unauthorized modifications to the source code or binaries.
3. Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan and update dependencies used in the application. Verify the integrity and security of third-party libraries to prevent the inclusion of vulnerable components in the software supply chain.
4. Continuous Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect suspicious activities in real-time. Analyze logs regularly to identify any anomalies or signs of a supply chain compromise.
5. User Education and Communication: Educate users about the importance of downloading apps only from official app stores. Communicate security measures and best practices to help users identify potentially compromised versions of the application.

## **3- Insecure Authentication**

Insecure authentication results from implementing weak authentication practices in mobile application development. Simply put, Insecure Authentication arises from failing to confirm a user’s identity, thus allowing an attacker to acquire privileges to access sensitive data in your application.

**Prevention:**

- Do not allow users to enter 4-digit pins as passwords.
- Never store passwords on the local device. Always try to implement all authentication requests on the server side. The principle should also be applied to the app data. Application data should only be loaded onto the device until successful client-side Authentication.
- the data should be encrypted, and the encryption key should be securely derived from the user’s login credentials.

## **3- Insecure Authorization**

Insecure authorization gives privileges to verified users who should otherwise not have them.

privileges are a set of permissions that allows a user to perform specific tasks within the mobile application.

- Horizontal Privilege Escalation: This occurs when one user can access another user’s resources with similar privileges.
- Vertical Privilege Escalation: This occurs when an average user gains the privileges of another user at a higher level in the security hierarchy. This would include system administrators.

**Prevention:**

- The application should be designed to store all user role and permission information in the backend, and an authenticated user’s permissions should be verified with the same.
- All incoming identifiers associated with an operation should be independently verified with the roles and permission identifiers stored in the backend.

## **4- Insufficient Input/Output Validation**

Insufficient input/output validation exposes our application to critical attack vectors, including SQL injection, XSS, command injection and path traversal. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, code execution, and compromise of the entire backend system.

Insufficient input/output validation occurs when an application fails to properly check and sanitize user input or validate and sanitize output data.

**Prevention:**

- Input Validation:
  - Validate and sanitize user input using strict validation techniques.
  - Implement input length restrictions and reject unexpected or malicious data.
- Output Sanitization:
  - Properly sanitize output data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - Use output encoding techniques when displaying or transmitting data.
- Context-Specific Validation:
  - Perform specific validation based on data context (e.g., file uploads, database queries) to prevent attacks like path traversal or injection.
- Data Integrity Checks:
  - Implement data integrity checks to detect and prevent data corruption or unauthorized modifications.
- Secure Coding Practices:
  - Follow secure coding practices, such as using parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Regular Security Testing:
  - Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## **5- Insecure Communications**

Insecure communications occur when sensitive information is transmitted over an unencrypted or poorly secured channel, making it vulnerable to interception and exploitation by attackers. This can include communication over email, instant messaging, web applications, or other communication channels.

**Prevention:**

- Use encrypted communication channels: Sensitive information should only be transmitted over encrypted communication channels, such as SSL/TLS or other secure protocols.
- Implement secure communication protocols: Web applications and services should be configured to use secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS.
- Use secure messaging services: Sensitive information should only be transmitted over secure messaging services that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal or WhatsApp.
- Train employees: Employees should be trained on how to recognize and prevent insecure communications and the importance of using secure communication channels.
- Regularly update and patch systems: Systems and applications should be regularly updated and patched to ensure they are using the latest security protocols and are not vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities.

## **6- Inadequate privacy controls**

Inadequate privacy controls mean there aren’t solid steps in place to keep user information safe in mobile apps. This happens when there’s not enough protection like strong encryption, good access controls, effective session management, and clear consent methods. All of these things together make it more likely that someone could get into the app without permission and cause problems with user privacy.

**Prevention:**

1. Data Encryption Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both during transmission and storage. This safeguards information from unauthorized access. Implement industry-standard encryption protocols such as TLS for secure communication.
2. Robust Access Controls

Implement stringent access controls to restrict unauthorized users from accessing sensitive functionalities or data. Employ multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access critical features.

1. Effective Session Management Implement [secure session management practices](https://aspiainfotech.com/2023/10/02/effective-security-posture-management/), including session timeouts and token-based authentication. Regularly audit and monitor active sessions to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
2. Explicit Consent Mechanisms Provide clear and concise information to users regarding the data the app collects and how it will be used. Implement granular consent mechanisms that allow users to control and customize the data they are comfortable sharing.
3. Regular Security Audits Conduct regular security audits and [penetration testing](https://aspiainfotech.com/2022/07/16/internal-penetration-testing-vs-external-penetration-testing/) to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Stay updated with the latest security practices and integrate security into the development lifecycle.

## **7- Insufficient Binary Protections**

lack of binary protections results in a mobile app that can be analyzed, reverse-engineered, and modified by an adversary in rapid fashion.

- Can someone code-decrypt this app (iPhone specific) using an automated tool like ClutchMod or manually using GDB?
- Can someone reverse engineer this app (Android specific) using an automated tool like dex2jar?
- Can someone use an automated tool like Hopper or IDA Pro to easily visualize the control-flow and pseudo-code of this app?

**Prevention:**

First, the application must follow secure coding techniques for the following security components within the mobile app:

- Jailbreak Detection Controls
- Checksum Controls
- Certificate Pinning Controls
- Debugger Detection Controls

Next, the app must adequately mitigate two different technical risks that the above controls are exposed to:

1. The organization building the app must adequately prevent an adversary from analyzing and reverse engineering the app using static or dynamic analysis techniques
2. The mobile app must be able to detect at runtime that code has been added or changed from what it knows about its integrity at compile time. The app must be able to react appropriately at runtime to a code integrity violation.

## **9- Insecure Data Storage**

**Prevention:**

You should use Hashing algorithms like `MD5` and `SHA1` for 10 times or more to prevent storing plain text sensitive data. In addition, I prefer using secure encryption techniques and Key Store for more security.

## **10- Insufficient Cryptography**

Insufficient cryptography in the context of mobile applications is encryption that can easily be undermined. This could be due to flaws in the encryption process or due to the usage of weak encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data. the potential hacker is able to return the encrypted code or sensitive data to its original unencrypted form.

**Prevention:**

- Use encryption standards that you know will hold their own for at least 10 years into the future.
- Avoid storing sensitive data unencrypted.
- Avoid using easily-guessable encryption keys.
- Follow NIST guidelines on recommended algorithms.
